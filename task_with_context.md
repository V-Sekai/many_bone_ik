# AriaEwbik MultiIK Design Strategy

## Context and Background

This document outlines our strategy for implementing MultiIK (Multi-Effector Inverse Kinematics) in the AriaEwbik system, based on insights from the Godot ManyBoneIK3D implementation and the broader EWBIK (Entirely Wahba's-problem Based Inverse Kinematics) research.

### Current Godot ManyBoneIK3D Implementation Insights

**Existing GUI System:**
- **Sphere Visualization**: Current GUI uses small spheres (0.02f scale) to represent kusudama constraints
- **Shader Rendering**: Custom shader system for cone visualization with RGBA color data
- **Bone Selection**: Click-to-select bones with yellow/blue visual feedback
- **Edit Mode**: Toggle button for switching between view and edit modes
- **Real-time Updates**: Gizmos update dynamically with bone transformations

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Gizmo Plugin System**: EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin with Node3DEditor integration
- **Mesh Generation**: Procedural sphere creation with 8Ã—8 ring/radial segments
- **Coordinate Transforms**: Complex skeleton â†” gizmo â†” constraint space transformations
- **Material System**: ShaderMaterial with custom parameters for constraint visualization

**Current Limitations:**
- Basic sphere visualization (not advanced cone rendering)
- Limited multi-effector management
- No pole target visualization
- Manual constraint setup process

## Current Status

### EWBIK Implementation Progress

- âœ… **Phase 1**: Internal modules complete (Segmentation, Solver, Kusudama, Propagation)
- âœ… **Phase 1.5**: External API implementation (IN PROGRESS - Critical Priority)
- ðŸ”„ **MultiIK Design**: Strategy documented and ready for implementation

### Technical Foundation

- **37 tests passing** across 4 modules
- **Decomposition algorithm** implemented for multi-effector coordination
- **AriaJoint integration** for optimized transform calculations
- **QCP algorithm** ready for Wahba's problem solving

## MultiIK Design Strategy

### Core Principles (from Godot ManyBoneIK3D)

> "And after then I will continue to experiment with MultiIK in https://github.com/TokageItLab/godot/tree/multi-ik-3d. The things that have been almost decided are: Having a GUI that allows you to set one Root and multiple End Effectors, thereby eliminating duplicated joint and generating a split list at each junction, and allowing the use to set pole targets and limitations within that list. Then, there are too many things to discuss about the GUI, so we should set up a meeting somewhere and share mockups in the near future."

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Single Root, Multiple End Effectors

- **Root Node**: Single skeleton root for the entire IK chain
- **End Effectors**: Multiple target points (hands, feet, head, etc.)
- **Automatic Junction Detection**: System identifies branch points in skeleton hierarchy

#### 2. Junction-Based Chain Splitting

- **Branch Detection**: Automatic identification of skeleton junctions
- **Chain Segmentation**: Split effector lists at each junction
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure proper solve order (parents before children)

#### 3. Pole Target and Limitation Support

- **Pole Targets**: Control twist/swing orientation at each junction
- **Joint Limitations**: Per-joint angle constraints (Kusudama cones)
- **Priority Weighting**: Effector opacity and influence control

## Implementation Architecture

### Multi-Effector Solver Hierarchy

```elixir
# ChainIK â†’ ManyBoneIK â†’ BranchIK progression
defmodule AriaEwbik.MultiEffectorSolver do
  def solve_chain_ik(skeleton, single_chain) do
    # Simple chain solving (no branching)
    solve_simple_chain(skeleton, single_chain)
  end

  def solve_many_bone_ik(skeleton, effector_targets) do
    # Complex multi-effector solving
    {groups, effector_groups} = Decomposition.decompose_multi_effector(skeleton, effector_targets)
    solve_with_groups(skeleton, groups, effector_groups)
  end

  def solve_branch_ik(skeleton, effector_targets, branch_points) do
    # Extended ManyBoneIK for branched skeletons
    solve_branched_multi_effector(skeleton, effector_targets, branch_points)
  end
end
```
